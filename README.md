## Installation
Since the application is written using SpringBoot, a JVM is a must. Please install Java version 11 as a minimum. Also MySQL is used to store all data. And since the application does not have a UI, you will also need Postman or Insomnia to perform the API calls.
````````````````````````
- Java 11
- MySQL Server
- Postman
````````````````````````
## Usage
````````````````````````
Since this is a backend application and the UI is not a requirement for this project, we will use Postman to demonstrate how it works. Just run the application from your IDE and use the file named "Project3-SportyShoes.postman_collection.json" to load the API calls you will use in Postman.
